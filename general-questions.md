# Are you contributing to open-source or doing some research on your free time?
I do read articles and post in several sources such as Medium, dev.to and so on.
I also participate in conference and meet-ups from time to time (Like AngularUP, few days ago.) 
I was about to start writing an open source app with a friend (that gives a task manager with a pipeline for backend developers), but it's on hold at the moment since my partner suffer serious injure. 
#Please specify projects worked on and if available on Github
The main project i worked on is not public, due to security reasons.

#What excites or interests you about coding?
I love working with the front end frameworks and tools, and I like it when I meet a powerful tool or solution the resolve an issue that I have in an elegant and smart way.
I also like the instant responses, that everything happens on the spot. 

#What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
I had a bug that the view did not update after a change is done, in a specific feature. 
It was caused by a data that came from 2 different sources (endpoints). It was a hard one to spot.
#What UI, Security, Performance, Maintainability or Technology considerations do you make while building a web application or site?
Things I'll consider: Browsers support, is it responsive? How big the project is? Expected traffic amount (and do we need to optimize performance and how), project structure

#If you were given the opportunity to start a project from scratch, how would you do it (an enterprise web application)? What technologies will be used? (for JS/CSS/HTML/Server) and why?
First I define the needs as clear and accurate as I can. What are the most impotent things to take care of. Then I look for options for solutions and compare them and checks what fits my needs the best. I won't hesitate to consulate with colleagues or team leader.


#How would you optimize a website&#39;s assets/resources (or how does the framework optimizes the resources)?
1. break the app into modules
1. Make sure all subscriptions have unsubscribe method onDestroy life cycle hook
1. Consider onPush strategy on big apps.
#Name 2 ways to decrease page load time (perceived or actual load time).
1. Minimize number of calls to externale resources (such as scripts, images)
1. Images lazy-loading.
